            <p className='text-lg text-gray-500'>At DO IT Organic, we have made organic food the standard. We firmly believe in a world where 100% organic food is the standard. As an organic food specialist, we offer high quality products. This is how we have slowly but surely risen to become the leading company in the field of organic food. But we do a whole lot more than just sell organic bulk health foods. What exactly?</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold text-[#039be6]'>We are an organic wholesaler with sustainable food from all over the world</h1>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-500'>We only offer fully organic products. In total we sell more than 1000 different organic products as an organic food wholesaler. These products are produced by our own organic farmers and producers. Our organic network reaches all over the world. We aim to get our products as close to home as possible to keep transport to the minimum.</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Which kind of exclusively organic products do we distribute?</h1>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-500'>As an organic products distributor, we buy our products directly from farmers all over the world. For example our organic wholesale contains organic raw ingredients, such as beans or other pulses from China, cashew nuts from Tanzania or lentils from Canada. We create personal relationships with farmers and build long-term partnerships with them. Our way of working is completely transparent, traceable and we use and arrange all the necessary certificates.</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Is our organic wholesale business all about a sustainable food supply?</h1>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-500'>Yes and yes. Of course, organic food ingredients plays the absolute leading role for us as an organic food wholesaler. But ‘organic’ goes far beyond our seeds, peanuts and rice. In the end, it is more about the underlying idea of making the world healthy and liveable again. Creating a 100% organic food chain is a very important step in that direction. But there are more things that we consider important. Think, for example, about packaging. We aim to be completely climate-neutral.
How? By using sustainable foil, labels, ink and glue for all our packaging. By housing our headquarters, warehouse and packaging facilities in one location, we can guarantee high quality products, while optimizing our logistics at a low carbon footprint.</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>The role of organic agriculture in producing sustainable food</h1>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-500'>Agriculture covers almost 40 percent of the surface of the globe. It therefore has a great impact on the environment. Organic farming is essential for a healthy world. That is why we put a lot of time and energy into the way our products are grown. Because it's not just about the products we produce. It's about making and keeping our planet healthy! That is what DO IT Organic and our organic products stand for.</p>
