Urea contains 46% nitrogen, the highest nitrogen content among solid fertilizers, making it cost-effective and efficient in delivering essential nutrients to plants. It is suitable for all soil types and a wide variety of crops, including cereals, maize, rice, sugarcane, and horticultural plants. Urea can be used directly on soil or dissolved in water for foliar application. Its versatility extends to industrial applications, including melamine, resin, and adhesive manufacturing. Each batch undergoes strict quality control to ensure low moisture, high biuret stability, and consistent granule size for even distribution in the field.",

The raw hides are freshly flayed, properly cured with natural salt, and preserved under hygienic conditions to maintain their natural strength, fiber density, and texture. We ensure that only defect-free hides, free from putrefaction, holes, and flay cuts, are selected for export. The raw hides and skins serve as premium raw materials for the global leather industry, suitable for processing into full-grain, corrected-grain, and split leather varieties used in footwear, upholstery, and fashion leather goods.",

This tanning process stabilizes the protein fibers, resulting in flexible, durable hides with a characteristic blue coloration. Wet Blue hides are the global standard intermediate material in the leather value chain, ready for further processing into finished leather for upholstery, footwear, automotive interiors, and luxury leather goods. Each hide is tanned in compliance with international REACH and environmental standards, ensuring consistent quality, low chrome VI content, and eco-friendly processing.",
