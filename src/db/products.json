Grown in lower-altitude regions under optimal tropical conditions, Robusta offers a bold taste profile with earthy, nutty, and cocoa notes. The beans have a natural resistance to pests and yield consistently high production volumes. Ideal for enhancing crema and texture in espresso blends, Robusta also forms the foundation for industrial and soluble coffee applications worldwide.",
